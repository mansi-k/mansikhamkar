# SSD Assignment2 - Portfolio webpage

## 1. Expectations :
1. I have included details about myself from `my resume` and created a `formal portfolio` page as it may be useful ahead.
2. I have included `5 sections` on the same page which are accesible form top manubar. (In the document it's mentioned atleast 3 pages`/sections`)
3. Website is designed using `HTML, Jquery, CSS, Bootstrap, W3CSS (as discussed on MS Teams)`.
4. `Separate CSS, HTML and script` files are created by myself.
5. The `script` file contains code to `validate the input fields` of 'Leave a Message' `form`. It shows error on empty fields and invalid email address and highlights the errored input fields.
5. I have downloaded fontawesome js file for the icons.
6. I have `included links` to my github and other social media accounts.
7. Tested the webpage on Mozilla and Chrome.
8. I have also uploaded images and other files in 'myfiles' folder.

## 2. Evaluation :
1. HTML and CSS files are successfully validated with W3C validator.
2. The website is mobile responsive.
